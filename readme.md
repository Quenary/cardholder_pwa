# Cardholder_pwa is an app for storing your discount cards in one place.
## Why:
Yet another card holder. There are many apps to accomplish this goal, but they are either distributed in app stores or lack some features. Here are some most important aspects:
- PWA stands for progressive web app, so you can install it on device (e.g. smartphone) from browser and use offline (read-only of course)
- Easy to self-host
- Open-source

### Core
- Angular for frontend
- Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for backend
